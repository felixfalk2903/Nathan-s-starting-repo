## Footnote

Everyone on the internet is always saying you don't need to school to become a developer and they are right, but one needs to be extremely dedicated to do this on their own. I can only suggest enrolling in uni again. There is a uni here in Bruges (where i live close by) that has a course in informatics, the program is 2 years, fully remote (you can even chose when to do your exams), in english, you can study without pressure when you have the time, all classes are video classes, you still get the support you would at uni by teams (the program). They teach everything i just listed up here even the useful stuff.

Here in belgium we have a name for this kind of course, its called a 'graduaat' so i looked it up and it would be a Non-degree-education.

If you would be interested in doing this i can send them a mail asking about foreign students. I know Belgians pay around 1000euro a year (so very affordable) but i'm uncertain about foreigners.
